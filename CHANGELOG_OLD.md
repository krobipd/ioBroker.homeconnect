# Older changes

## 1.16.0 (2026-09-04)

- Fixed: the door and "program running" data points keep their own name and explanation again — an update had given them the name of the underlying appliance value, two of them even the same one.
- Fixed: a failed object update no longer leaves a setting with an empty selection list until the next restart.
- Fixed: an account that briefly reports no appliance at all no longer removes every device folder.
- New: program options now carry a name in your language even while the appliance is switched off — until now they showed an English name there.
- Improved: the adapter's own data points for sign-in and information now get their current name and description on existing installations too.
- Fixed: an instance stopped right after it started no longer leaves its appliances showing as connected in the object tree.

## 1.15.0 (2026-09-02)

- New: every event has a name and a short explanation in your language — salt empty, rinse aid nearly empty, filter saturated — for all seventeen appliance types, from the very first start.
- New: the description now explains what a datapoint means instead of repeating the manufacturer's key, and where the adapter has nothing to explain it stays empty.
- Fixed: after an update, the event datapoints, the online marker and the channels kept the bare id as name — they are named properly now.
- Fixed: options of a program that is not currently selected keep the bare id no longer — their names come from Home Connect once more after the update.

## 1.14.0 (2026-09-02)

- New: every data point now carries a readable name in your language, straight from Home Connect, plus its technical key as description — no more bare ids in the object browser.
- New: channels, the online marker and the start/stop buttons are named in all eleven ioBroker languages, and the adapter keeps every name and description current itself on every update.
- Fixed: the instance no longer shows as connected while its live updates are down — a routine token refresh used to switch it to connected for a moment.
- Fixed: a login the event stream rejects is refreshed right away, so live updates no longer stay silent for up to a day after the token was revoked on the server side.
- Fixed: a text value written by a script into a switch or a number is now sent to the appliance as the proper on/off or number and confirmed in that form.
- Fixed: live updates that stall while connecting now recover on their own — until now such an attempt could hang until the instance was restarted, with no data arriving.
- Fixed: an appliance whose name in the app contains unusual characters now gets a clean device name instead of a broken one.
- New: a Test connection button in the settings makes a real request to Home Connect and tells you what it found — appliances listed and connected, live updates up or the exact reason why not.

## 1.13.0 (2026-09-01)

- Changed: device folders are now named by the type plate's E-number (e.g. `sx87tx02ce-60`); existing trees move automatically with values, history settings and renames — update your script ids once
- Changed: the appliance name from the app remains the displayed device name; two identical models are told apart by a serial-based suffix in the folder id
- Fixed: idle appliances no longer produce warnings at adapter start, and a quick stop right after start no longer leaves stale online markers behind

## 1.12.0 (2026-09-01)

- Fixed: data points no longer vanish while an appliance is switched off — a standby appliance reports only a subset, which used to delete the child lock. Only unpairing an appliance removes anything.
- New: everything is created upfront — the event catalog of your appliance type and the settable values of all its programs, so no data point appears only on first use.
- New: doors are real on/off states — open, locked where the door locks, and one per fridge compartment — and a running indicator shows at a glance whether a program is active.
- Fixed: nested appliance data such as fridge doors and lighting sat in a wrong misc folder and was read-only there — everything moves to its real place automatically, history settings included.
- New: appliances going online or offline are logged, and program details are fetched only once — program changes and reconnects no longer cost cloud requests.
- New: the settings page links straight to the Home Connect developer portal and explains where upgraders find the client secret of an existing application.

## 1.11.0 (2026-08-27)

- New: your appliances now show the green/grey icon in the object browser — the reachable value was already there, it just was not linked to the icon.
- New: three data points show how many appliances are paired, how many are connected right now, and whether all of them are.
- Fixed: stopping the adapter no longer leaves every appliance showing as connected, and a start-up without a working sign-in no longer keeps the old values.
- Changed: an appliance you remove from your Home Connect account is now removed here too, with its whole subtree. Switching an appliance off keeps it, as before.

## 1.10.0 (2026-08-22)

- Fixed: Stopping or restarting the instance now really ends the sign-in; the adapter no longer keeps contacting Home Connect after it has shut down.

## 1.9.0 (2026-08-18)

- New: after an update from the previous adapter generation only the readable device tree remains — no left-over raw entries, and you stay signed in.
- New: each appliance now shows whether it is currently online, so stale values are recognizable at a glance.
- New: newly available programs, changed option ranges and units now show up on existing installations — no need to delete objects first.
- Fixed: when the Home Connect login is revoked, the adapter asks for a fresh sign-in by itself (link in the settings, notification and log) instead of staying silent until a restart.
- Fixed: the sign-in link in the settings renews itself when it expires, so it always works when you open it.
- Fixed: settings the appliance declares as read-only are no longer offered as switchable.
- Improved: number values carry the appliance's allowed step size, and device names with accented letters get clean object paths.
- Improved: clearer logging — a brief cloud outage no longer claims that no appliances were found, recoveries are reported, and a write dropped during a rate-limit pause is visible.

## 1.8.0 (2026-08-11)

- New: the Home Connect sign-in now happens right in the adapter settings — the one-time link and a live "signed in" status appear there, and also as a notification.
- Sign-in is more robust: a brief network problem during a restart no longer asks you to sign in again, and an expired access token is refreshed automatically instead of failing silently.
- Writing settings, options or programs works again immediately after an adapter restart, even while the appliance is switched off.
- More stable when the Home Connect cloud is briefly unreachable or busy — the adapter backs off and recovers on its own instead of hammering it.
- Requires Admin 8 now (the settings sign-in panel is an Admin-8 component).

## 1.7.1 (2026-08-06)

- Fixed the repository links and adapter logo so they resolve to the correct place.

## 1.7.0 (2026-08-06)

- Complete rewrite. Every value now arrives ready to use: on/off as switches, fixed choices as readable names, and temperatures and times as numbers with their unit.
- Programs, status and events update live through a single connection, so changes on the appliance show up in ioBroker within seconds instead of on a poll.
- Full program control: select a program, set options such as temperature, spin speed or delayed start, then start, stop or pause it from ioBroker.
- Every data point now has a short, readable name, so appliance values are easy to find and use in scripts, charts and visualisations.
