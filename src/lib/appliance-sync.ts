   * first, then the copy ({@link copyDeviceTree}: objects with their recording settings, values,
   * alias targets, the mark last), then the delete of the old tree, which carries the room and

   * finishes what is left — as long as the delete has not begun: the recursive delete removes the
   * old device object, and with it the journal, first.
